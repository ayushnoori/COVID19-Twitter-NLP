# COVID-19 Twitter + NLP

This research project aims to identify the most prevalent COVID-19 questions shared in public opinion by applying machine learning tools to public datasets of COVID-related tweets. We intend to identify COVID tweets containing expressed uncertainty or scientific questions, and apply natural language processing algorithms such as topic modeling via latent semantic analysis to cluster questions into overarching "meta-questions" widespread across the public. Answers to these "meta-questions" can then be posted on a publicly-available, interactive website. 

Rather than access the Twitter COVID-19 streaming endpoint directly, we plan to use the pre-curated [USC JIMR](https://publichealth.jmir.org/2020/2/e19273/) Dataset. Aggregate Twitter content may be displayed on our website to support conclusions derived from machine learning models, as well as individual tweets as specific case studies. 

We hope that our work will help answer popular questions about the ongoing pandemic, dispel uncertainty, and foster the dissemination of reputable facts in a post-truth world.
